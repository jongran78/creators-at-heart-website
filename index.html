                <p>Carol has been an accomplished art teacher for over 30 years and since 
                    retiring has delved into pleinair painting as her primary interest. Charlie
                    was a successfully talented graphic designer who has taken his design background and
                    applied it directly to sculpture and jewelry. Both Carol and Charlie are likewise talented Photographers. 
                    They spent over 8 years developing a successful photography
                    business yet, as all things change....Years later, Carol and Charlie are
                    entering a new passage in life.<br><br>

                Both Carol and Charlie fell in love with the camera and the still
                image circa 2007. They dove in head first, absorbing all they could about
                lighting, portrature, and studio techniques-even building a collapsable 
                make-shift studio in their garage. They developed their own process for 
                photographing weddings as well as landscapes. While they have since retired
                the business aspect of photography, they still enjoy framing visually stimulating
                images that breath life into any room.

                After partaking in a 3 month seminar and workshop on jewelry making,
                both Carol and Charlie have set about sculpting unique wearable art-
                Mostly made of plyable special clays. With a number of various designs, 
                these pieces are meant to compliment your style, whichever it may be. Each
                piece comes in your choice of color or material.

                <p>Carol has been an avid plein air painter with an appetite
                   for travel and cultural diversity. She has painted in a variety
                   of locals from Ireland to Taiwan and Uganda. Though she paints
                   with an array of paint mediums, her go-to is acrylic due to her
                   quest for brilliant colors and the textural properties of acrylic paints.
                   "I am ever intrugued by the beauty of earths geography, remote locations
                   and the people who inhabit them." "I'm curious about how the local people
                   adapt to their location and what technology exists because of their relation
                   to the land."

                <p>Inspired by the natural kettles and moraines of the country side
                   where he grew up, Charlie sculpts fluid, abstract objects that could
                   fill a public space just as eloquently as a display shelf of a modern
                   home. Recently he has been taken by the onset of the 3-D printer and has employed
                   them to create his most recent works.
